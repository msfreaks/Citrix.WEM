# Citrix.WEM
Powershell module for Citrix WEM

I started this project after onboarding several environments using Citrix WEM.
Got real tired of adding applications to the WEM Actions manually.

Using the functions in this module will create .xml files you can then import (restore) into WEM.
This function will not modify WEM or its database directly!

    This function only works on GPO Backup files, it will not communicate directly with
    Active Directory to retreive the settings.
